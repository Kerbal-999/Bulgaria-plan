Click on the file name to open that file in GitHub, it will take you to this page:

To access the file, press "view raw", "RAW", or the download icon to download the file. You can now edit this file in whatever spreadsheet program you have (I'd just use Microsoft 365 online)

Save the file and upload back to GitHub by pressing "Add file" on the main page, "upload file", choose a file.

You can write a short note if you like describing the change, but that's not really necessary. Press "Commit" and the updated file will be uploaded. 



Why are we using GitHub?
GitHub offers a repository we all have access to, and can edit which also provides version control - meaning if someone screws something up, I can easily fix it, without destroying any progress we have made since. It means we have everything in one place. 
Also, we can create timelines as well as other usefull  features offered by GitHub.
