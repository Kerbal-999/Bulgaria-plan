If you have never used GitHub before, here's a quick guide:

Click on the file name to open that file in GitHub, it will take you to this page:

To access the file, press "view raw", "RAW", or the download icon to download the file. You can now edit this file in whatever spreadsheet program you have (I'd just use Microsoft 360 online)
